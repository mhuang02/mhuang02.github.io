  <p>Released in October 2009, League of Legends has solidified itself as one of the most popular played video games for the past decade.
    At its core, League of Legends is a 5v5 MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game where two teams of players face off against one another,
    and race to see who can destroy the other team’s base first. Although the game has evolved over its lifespan, the core gameplay of teams trying 
    to create an advantage over the team has stayed consistent. Being a complex game with many factors influencing a game’s state and outcome, 
    are there any specific factors that can predict the outcome of a game? These are some questions that we aim to answer in this tutorial.  </p>

<h2>What features make up a game of League of Legends?</h2>
<p>The game takes place on a map with a main base (nexus), with three main lanes expanding out from the main base. Each lane contains an inhibitor, and 
   three towers that protect enemies from entering the main base. The main objective of the game is to destroy the enemies main base by marching 
   down one(or multiple) lanes, destroying towers and inhibitors along the way. 

   Throughout the game, players from both teams are able to unlock and upgrade their champions’ abilities as they level up, which can be achieved through 
   a couple of different ways. Players can level up by defeating enemy champions in combat, granting them experience, as well as gold, which can be used to 
   buy items in an item shop that increases a player’s stats (attack damage, magic damage, movement speed, health, to name a few), which creates an advantage 
   for that player. Another way that players can level up is through killing lane minions, which are NPC’s (non-playable characters) that spawn every 30 
   seconds and grant gold and experience upon death.

   In this tutorial, we will be analyzing how multiple factors such as gold difference, team color, (add more) from around 10,000 Diamond ranked games, 
   can predict a game’s outcome. By analyzing this data, we hope to better explore the different facets that contribute toward game results, and gain 
   insights into strategies and patterns that lead to success in the competitive scene.</p>
